# Decision Modelling — Pricing & Overbooking Optimisation

## Business Problem
Hospitality operators face uncertainty in reservations, cancellations, and walk-in demand during peak periods.

## Objective
Use decision modelling and simulation to identify pricing and overbooking strategies that maximise risk-adjusted profit.

## Tools
- Excel
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Probability distributions

## Approach
- Modelled stochastic demand and cancellations
- Simulated multiple pricing and overbooking scenarios
- Compared profit distributions and risk profiles

## Key Recommendation
Set higher room price with moderate overbooking to achieve optimal risk-adjusted returns.

## Business Value
Enables evidence-based decisions under uncertainty.
