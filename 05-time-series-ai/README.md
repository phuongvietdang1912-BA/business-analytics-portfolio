# Time-Series & AI — Air Quality Forecasting

## Business Problem
Accurate short-term air quality forecasts are essential for public health alerts and operational planning.

## Objective
Forecast PM2.5 levels 24 hours ahead using deep learning time-series models.

## Tools
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- GRU and LSTM models

## Approach
- Multivariate time-series modelling
- Direct multi-step forecasting
- Benchmarking against naïve baselines

## Key Results
- GRU model outperformed baseline forecasts
- Accuracy strongest in short horizons (first 6–12 hours)

## Business Impact
Supports early warning systems and pollution response planning.
